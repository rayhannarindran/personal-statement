% Hook -> Real conflict that you grew from
Growing up in Indonesia, contrast between our resource-rich nation and neighboring countries like Singapore and Malaysia, 
who was once considered underdogs, are very striking. And i ask myself, despite our abundance, why can't we prevail in this
age of technology? And realized that the issue is not scarcity, but in our collective mindset. Many Indonesians grow up believing
success follows a single, safe path. Such as becoming doctors, businessman, or civil servants. Which leads us to be constrained
by our own expectations and fears of failure, limiting our innovation. I was raised in the same circumstances, but I choose to
make my own path, a leap of faith in my potential. I aim to break free of those constraints and contribute to Indonesia with innovation
and technological advancements. \GetUniversityName
